# ggcapdthemes

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The `ggcapdthemes` package provides a custom ggplot2 theme and functionality to incorporate guidance from the EPA's Clean Air Power Division (CAPD) Data Visualization Style Guide. Examples show how to implement the theme and color palettes and demonstrate best practices for building various chart types in R.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ggcapdthemes from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#NOTE: You will need the “devtools” package to utilize the install_github function
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("usepa/ggcapdthemes", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Example

Here we use the `resource_mix` dataset from eGRID 2018-2022 Summary data. We show the barplot using ggplot2 and and after applying the `scale_color_capd_discrete` and `theme_capd` functions.

```{r example}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggcapdthemes)

## build ggplot barplot
p_bar <- ggplot(data = resource_mix[resource_mix$year == 2022,]) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = generation_resource_mix, y = resource_label, fill = resource_label),
           stat = 'identity') + 
  labs(x = 'Generation Resource Mix (%)', y = 'Resource', fill = 'Resource', 
       title = '2022 eGRID Generation Resource Mix',
       caption = 'Data from 2022 eGRID summary data, Table 2') +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0))

## original chart
p_bar

## with capd theme
p_bar + theme_capd(orientation = 'vert')

## with fuel type color palette and capd theme
p_bar +
  scale_fill_capd_discrete(palette = 'fuel_type') +
  theme_capd(orientation = 'vert') 
```
